# Interactive Color Segmentation with Linear Programming
Implementation of the paper [Interactive color image segmentation with linear programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00138-008-0171-x) by Hongdong Li and Chunhua Shen

## How to start
Currently, there is a single program called 'main.py'.<br>
Go to the folder and launch a commandline environment where python3 is installed and execute `python main.py`.<br>
If this fails, see if you have any package missing.<br>

You can change the sample image to explore more. <br>

*fyi. program contains lots of spaghetti code that requires lots of refactoring*

## Additionally...
This is program is based on a paper published in 2008. <br>
It is less likely that you will get the optimal solution from this program. <br>
