# Interactive Color Segmentation with Linear Programming
Implementation of the paper [Interactive color image segmentation with linear programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00138-008-0171-x) by Hongdong Li and Chunhua Shen

# STILL ONGOING, CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM WILL FAIL TO EXECUTE PROPERLY 

## Dependencies
`
Gurobi: can download for free if you are a studnet (or a professor)<br>
tkinter: GUI helper<br>
cv2: image <br>
numpy: essential for python users learning data science <br>
scipy <br>
sklearn <br>
skimage <br>
`

## How to start
Currently, there is a single program called 'main.py'.<br>
Go to the folder and launch a commandline environment where python3 is installed and execute `python main.py`.<br>
If this fails, see if you have any dependency missing. (listed above) <br>

You can change the sample image to explore more. <br>

*fyi. program contains lots of spaghetti code that requires lots of refactoring*

## Additionally...
This is program is based on a paper published in 2008. <br>
It is less likely that you will get the optimal solution from this program. <br>
Written for studying purpose
